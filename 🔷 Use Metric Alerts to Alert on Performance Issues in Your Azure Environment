ðŸ”· Use Metric Alerts to Alert on Performance Issues in Your Azure Environment

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To set up metric alerts in Azure that monitor and alert on high CPU usage for virtual machines (VMs).

ðŸ“Œ Why does this matter?
Metric alerts help proactively monitor and address performance issues, ensuring the stability and reliability of applications running on Azure.

ðŸ“Œ Use cases:
- Organizations monitoring application performance
- IT departments ensuring system health
- Proactively identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks

ðŸ“Œ Steps to completion:
1. **Create the VM:**
   - Created a configuration script (`cloud-init.txt`) to stress the CPU:
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF > cloud-init.txt
   #cloud-config
   package_upgrade: true
   packages:
   - stress
   runcmd:
   - sudo stress --cpu 1
   EOF

Set up an Ubuntu Linux VM using the configuration script:
az vm create \
    --resource-group "[sandbox resource group name]" \
    --name vm1 \
    --location eastUS \
    --image Ubuntu2204 \
    --custom-data cloud-init.txt \
    --generate-ssh-keys

Create the Metric Alert Using the Azure Portal:

    Signed in to the Azure portal and selected Monitor.

    Created a new alert rule for the vm1 VM with the following settings:

        Signal name: Percentage CPU

        Threshold: Greater than 90%

        Severity: 2 - Warning

        Alert rule name: Cpu90PercentAlert

Create the Metric Alert Through the CLI:

    Obtained the resource ID of the vm1 VM:
VMID=$(az vm show \
    --resource-group "[sandbox resource group name]" \
    --name vm1 \
    --query id \
    --output tsv)

Created a new metric alert for CPU usage greater than 80%:
az monitor metrics alert create \
    -n "Cpu80PercentAlert" \
    --resource-group "[sandbox resource group name]" \
    --scopes $VMID \
    --condition "max percentage CPU > 80" \
    --description "Virtual machine is running at or greater than 80% CPU utilization" \
    --evaluation-frequency 1m \
    --window-size 1m \
    --severity 3

    View Your Metric Alerts in Azure Monitor:

        Returned to the Azure portal and selected Monitor > Alerts.

        Monitored the alerts and viewed details of the triggered alerts.

Metric alerts were successfully set up to monitor and alert on high CPU usage for the virtual machine.
