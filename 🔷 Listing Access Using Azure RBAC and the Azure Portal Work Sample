🔷 Listing Access Using Azure RBAC and the Azure Portal Work Sample
🎯 Objective:

This work sample demonstrates my ability to use Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to list role assignments for myself and a resource group. It highlights my understanding of how to navigate the Azure portal to review permissions and roles, ensuring proper access management in Azure.
❓ Why does this matter?

Proper access management is critical for maintaining security and compliance in Azure. By understanding how to list and review role assignments, I can ensure that users and resources have the appropriate level of access, minimizing the risk of unauthorized actions.
💡 Use cases:

    Reviewing my own role assignments to understand my permissions in Azure.

    Auditing role assignments for a resource group to ensure proper access control.

    Identifying inherited roles and their scope within the Azure hierarchy.

🛠️ Steps to completion:

    Listed my role assignments: Reviewed the roles assigned to me in the Azure portal.

    Listed role assignments for a resource group: Checked the roles assigned to a specific resource group.

    Explored built-in roles: Reviewed the list of built-in roles and their details.

🚀 Work Sample: Managing Access with Azure RBAC
1. Listing my role assignments

I reviewed my own role assignments using the following steps:

    Signed into the Azure portal.

    Clicked the ellipsis (...) on the Profile menu and selected My permissions.

    Reviewed the list of roles assigned to me, along with their scope (e.g., subscription, resource group).

2. Listing role assignments for a resource group

I checked the role assignments for a resource group named example-group:

    Searched for and selected Resource groups in the Azure portal.

    Selected the example-group resource group from the list.

    Navigated to Access control (IAM) in the left menu.

    Selected the Role assignments tab to view the list of users, groups, and their assigned roles.

        Noted which roles were scoped to This resource and which were Inherited from a parent scope.

3. Exploring built-in roles

I explored the list of built-in roles in Azure:

    In the Access control (IAM) pane, selected the Roles tab.

    Reviewed the list of built-in roles (e.g., Owner, Contributor, Reader).

    Selected a role (e.g., Contributor) and clicked View to see its details.

    Checked the Assignments tab to see the number of users and groups assigned to the role.

🎉 Conclusion

This work sample highlights my ability to use Azure RBAC to list and review role assignments. By understanding how to navigate the Azure portal and interpret role assignments, I can effectively manage access to Azure resources and ensure compliance with security policies.
