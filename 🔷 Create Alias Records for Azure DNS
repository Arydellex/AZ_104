ðŸ”· Create Alias Records for Azure DNS

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To set up a virtual network with two VMs and a load balancer, and configure an Azure alias record to dynamically direct traffic to the load balancer.

ðŸ“Œ Why does this matter?
Using Azure alias records ensures efficient load balancing and dynamic IP address resolution, enhancing the scalability and reliability of web services.

ðŸ“Œ Use cases:
- Organizations managing high-traffic websites
- IT departments implementing load balancing for web servers
- Ensuring dynamic and reliable DNS resolution

ðŸ“Œ Steps to completion:
1. **Set Up Test Environment:**
   - Ran the setup script in Azure Cloud Shell:
     - Cloned the repository from GitHub.
     - Executed the setup script to create a virtual network, load balancer, and two VMs.
   - Noted the public IP address for the load balancer.

2. **Create an Alias Record:**
   - Navigated to the resource group in the Azure portal.
   - Selected the DNS zone **wideworldimportsXXXX.com** (replacing "XXXX" with unique characters).
   - Added a new record set with the following values:
     - **Name:** Left blank (indicating the DNS zone apex)
     - **Type:** A
     - **Alias record set:** Yes
     - **Alias type:** Azure resource
     - **Azure resource:** Selected **myPublicIP**

3. **Verify DNS Configuration:**
   - Copied the public IP address from **myPublicIP**.
   - Pasted the IP address in a web browser to verify that the load balancer correctly directed traffic to one of the VMs.

The alias record was successfully created, and DNS resolution is working as expected.
