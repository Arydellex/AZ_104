ðŸ”· Create a DNS Zone and an A Record using Azure DNS

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To set up an Azure DNS and create a public DNS zone, followed by creating an A record to ensure proper domain resolution.

ðŸ“Œ Why does this matter?
DNS zones and records are crucial for directing traffic to your servers and ensuring that domain names resolve to the correct IP addresses, enhancing web accessibility and reliability.

ðŸ“Œ Use cases:
- Organizations hosting websites and services on Azure
- IT departments managing domain configurations
- Ensuring proper DNS resolution for web servers

ðŸ“Œ Steps to completion:
1. **Create a DNS Zone:**
   - Signed in to the Azure portal.
   - Searched for and selected **DNS zone** by Microsoft.
   - Created a DNS zone with the name **wideworldimportsXXXX.com** (replacing "XXXX" with unique characters).

2. **Configure the DNS Zone:**
   - Selected **Record Sets** and noted the NS record values.
   
3. **Create a DNS Record (A Record):**
   - Opened the **Record sets** pane and added a new record.
   - Configured the record with the following values:
     - **Name:** www
     - **Type:** A
     - **TTL:** 1 hour
     - **IP Address:** 10.10.10.10 (in a real-world scenario, this would be the public IP of the web server)

4. **Verify DNS Configuration:**
   - Used the **nslookup** tool in Cloud Shell to verify the DNS configuration.
   - Confirmed that the hostname **www.wideworldimportsXXXX.com** resolved to **10.10.10.10**.

Congratulations! The DNS zone and A record were successfully set up and verified.
