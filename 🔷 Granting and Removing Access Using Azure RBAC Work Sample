🔷 Granting and Removing Access Using Azure RBAC Work Sample
🎯 Objective:

This work sample demonstrates my ability to grant and remove access using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). I assigned the Virtual Machine Contributor role to a user at the resource group scope and later removed the assignment. This exercise highlights my understanding of least privilege principles and access management in Azure.
❓ Why does this matter?

Granting the least privileges necessary ensures that users have access only to the resources they need, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious actions. Proper access management is critical for maintaining security and compliance in Azure.
💡 Use cases:

    Assigning roles to users for specific tasks (e.g., managing virtual machines).

    Removing role assignments when access is no longer required.

    Ensuring compliance with least privilege principles.

🛠️ Steps to completion:

    Granted access: Assigned the Virtual Machine Contributor role to a user for a resource group.

    Removed access: Removed the role assignment when it was no longer needed.
