ðŸ”· Create Basic Azure Monitor Log Queries to Extract Information from Log Data

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To perform Azure Monitor log queries using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to gather system status, security events, and application data for further analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Why does this matter?
Extracting information from log data helps diagnose and resolve system issues effectively, ensuring the reliability and security of applications running on Azure.

ðŸ“Œ Use cases:
- Organizations monitoring system behavior and security
- IT departments diagnosing and resolving issues
- Proactively identifying and addressing performance and security concerns

ðŸ“Œ Steps to completion:
1. **Create Basic Azure Monitor Log Queries:**
   - Opened the Logs demo environment and entered a basic query to retrieve the 10 most recent security events:
   ```kusto
   SecurityEvent
       | take 10

Sorted data by time:
SecurityEvent
    | top 10 by TimeGenerated

Added a filter clause and time range:
SecurityEvent
    | where TimeGenerated < ago(30m)
    | where toint(Level) >= 10

Queried the AppEvents table for the "Clicked Schedule Button" event in the last 24 hours:

AppEvents 
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
    | where Name == "Clicked Schedule Button"
Displayed the number of different computers generating heartbeat events each week for the last three weeks as a bar chart:

Heartbeat
    | where TimeGenerated >= startofweek(ago(21d))
    | summarize dcount(Computer) by endofweek(TimeGenerated) | render barchart kind=default

    Use Predefined Azure Log Queries:

        Set a custom time range in the command bar.

        Selected predefined queries from the left toolbar:

            IT & Management Tools: Ran the "Distinct missing updates cross computers" query to return a list of missing Windows updates.

            Azure Monitor: Ran the "Computers availability today" query to create a time series chart.

            Function App: Ran the "Show application logs from Function Apps" query to return a list of application logs sorted by time.
Basic and predefined Azure Monitor log queries were successfully created to extract valuable information from log data.
