🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Gain hands-on experience with Linux Bash commands in Azure Cloud Shell, learning system navigation, file management, and automation techniques.

❓ WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
- 🚀 Cloud Management: Azure Cloud Shell allows remote administration without local setup.
- 🖥️ System Administration: Mastering Bash commands improves efficiency in handling Linux environments.
- 🎓 Career Growth: Essential for DevOps, Cloud Engineers, and System Admin roles.

📌 USE CASES:
✔️ Manage cloud-based Linux environments efficiently.
✔️ Automate administrative tasks using Bash scripting.
✔️ Troubleshoot system configurations with built-in tools.
✔️ Access persistent storage in Azure Cloud Shell.

🛠️ PROJECT STEPS:
══════════════════════════════════════════════

🔹 STEP 1: ACCESS AZURE CLOUD SHELL**
   - Open Azure Cloud Shell at: 🌐 https://shell.azure.com
   - Select **Bash** as the terminal environment.

🔹 STEP 2: EXPLORE THE FILE SYSTEM**

   ls      # List files and directories
   pwd     # Print current directory path
   ls -a   # Show hidden files

🔹 STEP 3: UNDERSTAND DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

cd ~     # Navigate to home directory
cd ..    # Move up one level

🔹 STEP 4: USE COMMAND HISTORY

!!       # Repeat last command
!n       # Execute nth command from history
history  # View previous commands

🔹 STEP 5: ENABLE AUTOCOMPLETION

ls .a<TAB>  # Auto-completes file names starting with 'a'

🔹 STEP 6: VIEW FILE CONTENTS

cat filename.txt  # Display file contents

🔹 STEP 7: RESET THE CLOUD SHELL

cd ~
rm -rf .azure/commands/

══════════════ 🎯 COMPLETION & LEARNING OUTCOMES: ══════════════
✅ Navigate and manipulate files in Linux. 
✅ Utilize Bash efficiently for system administration. 
✅ Work seamlessly in Azure Cloud Shell.

🚀 Happy Coding!
